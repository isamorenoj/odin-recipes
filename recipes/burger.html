    </ol>
    
    <h5><strong>Prep Toppings and Buns:</strong></h5>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Remove wilted leaves from lettuce to keep it crunchy then finely shred lettuce. Slice tomatoes, onions, and pickles.</li></p>

        <p><li>Once patties are smashed, peel back and discard parchment papers and season patties with salt, pepper and garlic powder.</p> <p>Add 1/2 teaspoon of burger sauce. Cook 2 minutes on the first side or until seared and juices start to come to the surface.</li></p>
        <p><li>Scrape under the burger with spatula facing down at a 45˚ angle to get under the caramelized part and flip. Cook another 1 minute.</p> <p>Top half of the patties with sliced cheese and cover cheese with the second patty.
