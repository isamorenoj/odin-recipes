    </ul>
    <h4>Chocolate Buttercream</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups (2.5 sticks or 290g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>3 and 1/2 cups (420g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder <em>(natural or dutch process)</em></li>
        <li>3–5 Tablespoons (45-75ml) heavy cream <em>(or half-and-half or milk)</em>, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li><em><strong>optional for decoration: semi-sweet chocolate chips</strong></em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</strong> Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. <p>Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Make the cake:</strong> Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. <p>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. <p>Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, <p>add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Divide batter evenly between pans.</strong> Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. <p>Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</p> <p>(Note: Even if they’re completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center.</p> <p>Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It’s normal!)</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack.</strong> Allow to cool completely in the pan.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Make the buttercream:</strong> With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy – about 2 minutes.</p> <p>Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip.</p> <p>Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Assemble and frost:</strong> If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes.</p> <p>Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting.</p> <p>Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape.</strong></p> <p>After that, you can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4–6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.</strong> I like using a cake carrier for storing and transporting.</p></li>
